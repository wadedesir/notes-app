# 📝 Notes App
Welcome to the **Notes App**, a simple and user-friendly application for managing notes. The application is powered by a backend API and a frontend interface. Explore the details of each component below:

## 🌐 Frontend

### [📝 Frontend README](frontend/README.md)
The frontend of the Notes App is built with React, Vite.js, and Tailwind CSS. It provides an intuitive interface for users to manage notes, with features like adding, editing, and deleting notes, as well as user authentication through login and signup forms.

## 🛠 Backend

### [📝 Backend README](backend/README.md)
The backend of the Notes App is powered by Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, and Docker. It provides a robust API for managing notes, handling user authentication, and interacting with a MongoDB database. The backend follows a modular architecture with routes, controllers, models, and utilities for different aspects of the application logic.

## 🧪 Testing
A key objective of this project was learning and implementing tests. The READMEs for both the frontend and backend provide detailed insights into the testing strategies and methodologies.
